## Description
The story is set in the 1st World War, in the western front. A squad of elite aly soldiers from the great war have been sent to a castle in search of a powerful german commander and his special parapsycological team, the "Paranormale Truppen" that is apparently preparing a powerful weapon to turn the tides of the war. The soldiers, not aware of the magic loop that cursed the castle and the nightmarish creatures born out of it, fell into a trap, getting captured and sent to the castle dungeon. Only with the spare ammo that they got left, they will have to scape the dungeon fighting all sorts of monsters to discover the truth of the castle and break the curse. We will focus on The British soldier, the leader of the team, that will try to make the squad succeed and finally scape the castle. If he dies, the whole team will fall with him.

The narrative in game is mainly based on our characters exploring the castle, which is divided on three segments (with subplots for each one): The dungeon, the main castle and the cursed tower. The soldiers will experience different things depending on the paths the player chooses. In the way to the cursed tower, our soldiers will find other cursed people trapped in the loop and trying to find a way out, their destinies will be decided by our decisions.

As a consequence of the base plot being an excuse for our characters to have an objective that can't be much interfered by too many subplots, the "complex" narrative is based on telling what happened in the castle in a organic way, with fight interactions, npcs and level elements. These details are based on the acts of the "Paranormale truppen" and how they lead them to the nightmare of the neverending loop. The commander Friedrich Von Kryptoleg studied for years the elder gods that ruled before the ones known in their time, with all the destruction from the war, he found an ancient artifact hidden in verdun fortress that works with the instructions in his ocultism books. The commander and his soldiers started investigating the artifact that worked with tortured souls and despair, the perfect ingredients while being in a war as crude and violent as this one. They activated the artifact but instead of dark soldiers controled by them, the artifact created a portal that let hundreds of dark criatures to our world as well as a magic field that traped the criatures in the castle and anyone that tried to enter it.
